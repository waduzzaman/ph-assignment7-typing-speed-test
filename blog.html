                                <strong>Local Storage:</strong> This read-only interface property provides access to the
                                Document's local storage object, the stored data
                                is stored across browser sessions. Similar to sessionStorage, except that localStorage data gets
                                cleared when the page
                                session ends -that is when the page is closed. It is cleared when the last “private” tab of a
                                browser is closed
                                (localStorage data for a document loaded in a private browsing or incognito session).
                                <br>
        
                                <strong>Session Storage </strong>objects can be accessed using the sessionStorage read-only
                                property. The difference between
                                sessionStorage and localStorage is that localStorage data does not expire, whereas
                                sessionStorage data is cleared when
                                the page session ends.
        
                                A unique page session gets created once a document is loaded in a browser tab. Page sessions are
                                valid for only one tab
                                at a time. Pages are only saved for the amount of time that the tab or the browser is open; they
                                do not persist after
                                the page reloads and restores. A new session is created each time a tab or window is opened;
                                this is different from
                                session cookies. Each tab/window that is opened with the same URL creates its own
                                sessionStorage.When you duplicate a
                                tab, the sessionStorage from the original tab is copied to the duplicated tab. Closing a
                                window/tab ends the session and
                                clears sessionStorage objects.

                                <strong>Global Scope </strong>
                                The variables defined outside of any function or curly brackets are known as global variables
                                and have global scope.
                                Global scope means that the variables can be accessed from any part of that program, any
                                function or conditional state
                                can access that variable.

                                <strong>Block Scope</strong>
                                Block scope is also a sub-type of local scope. The block scope can be defined as the scope of
                                the variables inside the
                                curly brackets {}. Now, these curly brackets can be of loops, or conditional statements, or
                                something else. You are only
                                allowed to refer to these variables from within the curly brackets {}.
